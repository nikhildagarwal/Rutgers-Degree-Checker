# Rutgers_Degree_Checker

This is a ongoing personal project that uses Object Oriented Programming In Java.

Current Purpose: Currently the project consists of a collections of Java classes that work together to store data in self created objects, while also being
an interactive program which responds to user input.

This project makes use of System.in and the console. The inputs that this program expects is a description of a course offered by Rutgers University. The end goal is
to create a working list of courses taken by a particular student, to sort the list, output the list, return the gpa of the student, as well as credits completed and 
check to see if the student has the requirements or is on track to graduate.

Input consists of CourseCode, credits, Semester, Year, Grade.

Ex:  01:198:206  4  Fall 2022  A  

After clicking run, the example inputTestCase.txt file can be copy pasted into the console. After hitting enter, press Q. "Q" is the signal for our driver class
(RunChecker.java) to terminate. After terminating the program will output a list of courses that we have input. It will also output the total credits completed
by the student as well as the students current GPA.

*NOTE* the test cases are real, complete, and pulled directly from my own transcript.

Functionalities are still being added, and the project will be updated as working progress is made. This personally is useful to me and could also be very useful
to other students.
